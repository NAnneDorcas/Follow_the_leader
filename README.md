# Problem with a code 
* Leader robot - moving
* Follower robot - ???

# Documentation
soon

# How to run the code
1. On leader robot, save us_sensor_reading.py to pi pico, check wiring!!
2. On leader robot, use threshold codes to detect finish
3. On follower robot, use threshold code to detect leader robot
4. Put follower robot behind leader
5. Run the both codes, try running at the same time  

# Overview
## Our project consists of the following key components:
1. Our project is  follow the leader, we will be using two robots, cameras, battery, ultrasonic sensors for the leader robot, Raspberry Pi Pico, Raspberry Pi
2. First robot(leader robot) goes through the obstacles and the second robot(following robot) follows the first robot by tracking an orange paper that will be placed behind the leader robot
3. Leader robot will be using image processing and ultrasonic sensors to avoid the obstacles and detect finish
4. Follower robot will be using image processing to track the first robot
5. The leader robot and following robot will not communicate with each other
6. We will be using cardboard boxes as obstacles, yellow paper for finish and an orange paper to track leader robot
7. We make the obstacle course ourselves
8. Both robots must get through the course without crashing into each other or the obstacles
9. The following robot needs to able to handle briefly losing sight of the leading robot
10. Both robot will arrive safely to finish
